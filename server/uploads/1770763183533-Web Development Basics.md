33. What is CSRF?
Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is an attack that forces a user to
execute unwanted actions on a web application in which they're
authenticated.
34. What is hashing?
• Hashing transforms input data into a fixed-size string of characters,
which is typically a digest that uniquely identifies the input.
35. What is encryption?
• Encryption converts data into a coded form to prevent unauthorized
accesS.
